# RFID-Secure-Access-System

The main objective of this project is to provide security in an organization by allowing authorized personnel to access the loads. For this purpose the authorized personnel are provided with an RFID tags. 
This tag contains an integrated circuit that is used for storing, processing information, modulating and demodulating the radio frequency signal that is being transmitted. 
Thus, once the person shows the RFID tag to the RFID card reader it scans the data present on the tag and compares it with that of the data present in the system and once it matches the load will be turned ON which is driven by relay and it displays the message saying authorized or else states unauthorized and doesnâ€™t allow the access.
